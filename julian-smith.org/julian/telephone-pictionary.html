<p> Telephone Pictionary is a cross between the classic game of Telephone and Pictionary. </br>Players alternate writing phrases and drawing pictures that describe those phrases. </br>Just like in the classic game of Telephone the message starts to get lost!  </br>I've created a very basic online version here for safe play during social distancing.
