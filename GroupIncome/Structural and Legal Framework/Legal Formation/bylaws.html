                    <div class="document-content">
                        <p>Bylaws — internal operating rules (decision-making, leadership, membership, dissolution).</p>
<br>
<p>Article I — Name and Purpose</p>
<p>Section 1. Name</p>
<p>The name of the organization is Group Income Program (the “Corporation”).</p>
<p>Section 2. Purpose</p>
<p>The Corporation is organized exclusively for charitable, educational, and research purposes under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code. The mission is to:</p>
<p>Operate a community-based income sharing program to provide a stable, livable baseline income to participants.</p>
<p>Conduct research and educational activities related to income sharing, economic equity, and mutual aid systems.</p>
<p>Facilitate affinity groups and flexible income-sharing structures while maintaining transparency and long-term program sustainability.</p>
<p>Serve as a model for income-sharing systems that can be adopted by communities domestically and internationally.</p>
<br>
<p>Article II — Members and Participants</p>
<p>Section 1. Membership</p>
<p>The Corporation shall have no members in the legal sense unless explicitly specified. Participants in the program are “participants” with defined rights and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Section 2. Participant Eligibility</p>
<p>Individuals may join the program through a formal application and acceptance process.</p>
<p>Acceptance and re-entry are based on the Board-approved criteria to maintain program stability.</p>
<p>Section 3. Participant Rights and Responsibilities</p>
<p>Participants contribute a fixed percentage of effective income (base program, e.g., 10%).</p>
<p>Participants may join affinity groups, which allow higher intra-group income sharing without reducing base contributions.</p>
<p>Participants may leave the program or an affinity group at any time, retaining funds already received but ceasing future participation.</p>
<p>Re-entering participants follow the 1% ramp-up rule:</p>
<p>First re-entry: 1% contribution for first two months, then doubling until base rate (e.g., 10%) is reached.</p>
<p>Subsequent re-entries: ramp period increases linearly based on number of previous exits, per Board policy.</p>
<p>Section 4. Termination</p>
<p>Participants may be removed for failure to comply with program rules or conduct that threatens program stability, as determined by the Board.</p>
<br>
<p>Article III — Board of Directors</p>
<p>Section 1. Powers and Responsibilities</p>
<p>The Board manages the affairs of the Corporation, including strategic direction, financial oversight, legal compliance, and program governance.</p>
<p>See Board Charter for detailed roles and responsibilities.</p>
<p>Section 2. Composition</p>
<p>5–9 Directors, serving staggered terms of 2–3 years.</p>
<p>Board may include non-voting advisory members.</p>
<p>Section 3. Meetings</p>
<p>Regular quarterly meetings; special meetings as needed.</p>
<p>Quorum: majority of Directors.</p>
<p>Voting: majority vote, except for major programmatic changes requiring supermajority.</p>
<p>Section 4. Officers</p>
<p>Chair/President, Vice-Chair, Treasurer, Secretary; additional roles may be defined.</p>
<p>Section 5. Committees</p>
<p>Board may establish committees (Finance, Research & Evaluation, Community & Participant).</p>
<br>
<p>Article IV — Programs and Operations</p>
<p>Section 1. Income Sharing Program</p>
<p>Base contribution percentage applies to all participants (e.g., 10%).</p>
<p>Affinity groups may increase shared percentage within their group; contributions stack but total contributions may never exceed 100%.</p>
<p>Debt payments reduce effective income for contribution purposes. Debt rules are defined by Board-approved policy.</p>
<p>Windfalls and wealth taxes applied as a percentage of income-equivalent value using the 4% rule.</p>
<p>Section 2. Buffer Fund</p>
<p>1–5% of monthly inflows reserved for stabilization and emergency coverage.</p>
<p>Section 3. International Adjustments</p>
<p>PPP dollar adjustments applied to ensure equitable payouts across countries.</p>
<p>Residency (where participant is living) determines PPP adjustment, not citizenship.</p>
<p>Section 4. Research/Education Compliance</p>
<p>Program designed as a living research experiment under IRS 501(c)(3) research/education classification.</p>
<p>Contributions are tax-deductible; payouts are considered programmatic support, not taxable income.</p>
<br>
<p>Article V — Affinity Groups</p>
<p>Section 1. Formation</p>
<p>Participants may create or join multiple affinity groups.</p>
<p>Affinity groups may be group-managed or individually managed.</p>
<p>Section 2. Contributions and Payouts</p>
<p>Contributions to affinity groups are separate from base program contributions.</p>
<p>Group rules may allocate a portion of funds to communal accounts, exit funds, retirement funds, or individual nest-egg accounts.</p>
<p>Section 3. Exit Rights</p>
<p>Participants may leave affinity groups at any time.</p>
<p>Leaving reverts participant to base program and other affinity group memberships.</p>
<br>
<p>Article VI — Financial Management</p>
<p>Section 1. Fiscal Year</p>
<p>The fiscal year aligns with the U.S. tax year: January 1 – December 31.</p>
<p>Section 2. Budget and Oversight</p>
<p>Board approves annual budget and payout schedules.</p>
<p>Platform tools track participant income, contributions, and payouts.</p>
<p>Individual participant data remains private; organizational finances are transparent.</p>
<p>Section 3. Banking and Investments</p>
<p>Funds managed in corporate accounts; investment strategies follow Board-approved policy.</p>
<p>Section 4. Dissolution</p>
<p>Upon dissolution, remaining assets distributed to other 501(c)(3) organizations or charitable purposes, consistent with IRS rules.</p>
<br>
<p>Article VII — Amendments</p>
<p>Bylaws may be amended by two-thirds vote of the Board.</p>
<p>Amendments must be consistent with Articles of Incorporation and IRS 501(c)(3) requirements.</p>
<br>

<p>Section 4. Election and Term of Service</p>
<p>Directors shall serve terms of two (2) years and may be re-elected.</p>
<p>The initial Board shall be appointed by the incorporators; thereafter, new Directors shall be elected by majority vote of the existing Board.</p>
