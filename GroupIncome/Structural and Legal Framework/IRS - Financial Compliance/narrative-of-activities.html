<p>Organization Name: Group Income Program</p>
<p>Purpose: To provide economic stability, conduct research on income-sharing systems, and educate communities on equitable financial models.</p>
<br>
<h3>Program Overview</h3>
<p>The Group Income Program is a nonprofit initiative designed to ensure participants maintain a stable, livable baseline income while studying the effects of shared economic systems. The program combines principles of mutual aid, income averaging, and collective risk protection with structured research to evaluate participant outcomes, community dynamics, and program effectiveness.</p>
<p>Participants contribute a fixed percentage of their effective income to a shared pool. Contributions are adjusted for debt obligations and windfalls. Funds are redistributed equitably so that all participants receive the same base payout. Optional affinity groups allow participants to share additional income within smaller, trusted subgroups, fostering collaboration, experimentation, and community resilience.</p>
<p>The program operates as a research and education nonprofit, meaning contributions are tax-deductible, and payouts are considered part of the program rather than taxable income for participants.</p>
<br>
<h3>Program Activities</h3>
<ul>
<li>Income Redistribution</li>
</ul>
<p>Collect a fixed percentage of participant effective income.</p>
<p>Adjust contributions for debt and wealth equivalents (windfalls and investments using 4% rule).</p>
<p>Redistribute funds equitably, ensuring a predictable baseline payout.</p>
<p>Annual payout rates are announced in advance for stability; contributions are tracked monthly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Affinity Groups</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants may voluntarily join affinity groups to share additional income.</p>
<p>Contributions to affinity groups are separate from the base program pool.</p>
<p>Participants can leave affinity groups at any time, retaining autonomy and protection from abuse.</p>
<p>Affinity groups may manage shared resources, community projects, or retirement/exit funds, according to flexible group rules.</p>
<ul>
<li>Debt and Wealth Considerations</li>
</ul>
<p>Contributions account for eligible debt obligations to reduce participant burden.</p>
<p>Windfalls and extraordinary assets are taxed for wealth equivalence, not as income, ensuring fairness and sustainability.</p>
<ul>
<li>Buffer Fund</li>
</ul>
<p>A small percentage of contributions is held in a buffer to stabilize payouts and provide emergency coverage.</p>
<ul>
<li>Research and Evaluation</li>
</ul>
<p>Collect anonymized data on contributions, payouts, participation, and outcomes.</p>
<p>Track KPIs including income stability, program retention, participant engagement, and long-term economic mobility.</p>
<p>Conduct qualitative research through surveys, interviews, and feedback sessions.</p>
<p>Analyze results to refine program design, test income-sharing models, and share findings publicly.</p>
<ul>
<li>Education and Community Building</li>
</ul>
<p>Provide participants with handbooks, orientation materials, and ongoing guidance.</p>
<p>Facilitate monthly community-building activities, peer check-ins, and educational workshops.</p>
<p>Support broader learning about income-sharing systems and collaborative economic models.</p>
<br>
<h3>Participants</h3>
<p>Eligible individuals join the program according to established criteria.</p>
<p>Participants may exit and rejoin; contributions follow structured ramp-up rules (e.g., 1% for initial months per re-entry) to maintain program stability.</p>
<p>All participants receive the same base payout, regardless of personal income variations.</p>
<p>International participants receive PPP-adjusted payouts to ensure equitable value across countries.</p>
<br>
<p>Financial and Legal Compliance</p>
<p>Contributions are tax-deductible for U.S. participants.</p>
<p>Payouts are not taxable as income because they are part of a nonprofit research/education initiative.</p>
<p>Program finances are fully transparent at the organizational level; individual participant financial data remains private.</p>
<p>The program complies with all applicable nonprofit regulations, including IRS rules for 501(c)(3) research/education organizations.</p>
<br>
<h3>Expected Outcomes</h3>
<p>Provide participants with reliable baseline income and economic stability.</p>
<p>Conduct research to evaluate income-sharing systems and community dynamics.</p>
<p>Produce educational materials, publications, and reports for public dissemination.</p>
<p>Establish a flexible platform for income-sharing models that can be adapted by others.</p>
