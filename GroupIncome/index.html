            <p>Security is not built through barricades, but through shared prosperity: by supporting one another, we reduce the need for harm.</p>

            <p>Our mission is to create a cooperative group income system that ensures everyone in the community has access to basic necessities — food, clothing, and housing — predictable support to protect against sudden financial loss, and the freedom to move beyond harm or exclusion.</p>
            <p>We do this by enabling members to contribute according to their means and receive equitable support, fostering a system where stability and opportunity are shared, not hoarded. By pooling resources and supporting one another, participants create a resilient, mutually beneficial network that transforms economic security from a privilege into a shared human right.</p>
            <p>Through this program, we provide a practical, tangible way for individuals to protect themselves, help others, and participate in a community grounded in cooperation and fairness.</p>

            <p style="margin-bottom: 25px; font-style: italic; color: #6a6a6a;">The moral and ethical foundation upon which all decisions are made.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>1. Mutual Care</strong> We recognize that true security comes from one another. By contributing together and sharing in times of need, we build a foundation of collective stability that no individual could sustain alone.</li>
                <li><strong>2. Transparency</strong> Everyone has the right to understand how the system works — where funds come from, how they're distributed, and how decisions are made. Clear communication and open accounting sustain trust.</li>
                <li><strong>3. Autonomy and Consent</strong> Participation is always voluntary and revocable. Members have agency over their contributions and decisions. Consent is not a one-time act but an ongoing practice that keeps relationships healthy.</li>
                <li><strong>4. Equity Across Difference</strong> We measure fairness not by equal inputs, but by equal access to what is needed to live. Economic justice means accounting for differing contexts, not pretending they don't exist.</li>
                <li><strong>5. Solidarity, Not Charity</strong> We don't give out of pity or superiority — we share because our wellbeing is interdependent. Each person may be a contributor one month and a receiver the next; both roles are equally honorable.</li>
                <li><strong>6. Reliability and Stewardship</strong> Our stability depends on consistency. We act with care in managing shared resources, upholding commitments, and maintaining the systems that make trust possible.</li>
                <li><strong>7. Learning and Adaptation</strong> We treat this project as a living experiment in economic cooperation. Mistakes are opportunities for growth. Data, reflection, and dialogue guide continual refinement.</li>
                <li><strong>8. Dignity of All Work and Rest</strong> Every person deserves the ability to meet their needs and to rest without fear. We honor all forms of labor — paid or unpaid, visible or invisible — as essential to the whole.</li>

        <h2 class="gi-section-title">Narrative Overview</h2>
        <div class="gi-content-card">
            <p>The Group Income Program is a nonprofit initiative designed to ensure that all participants have access to a stable, livable income floor. Rooted in the principles of mutual care, transparency, and shared responsibility, the program creates a financial safety net that empowers individuals to live with dignity and stability while contributing to a resilient community.</p>
            <p>At its core, the program operates as a community-based income redistribution network. Each participant contributes a fixed portion of their income into a shared pool. Funds are then redistributed to bring each participant closer to the group’s average income, smoothing out fluctuations and providing stability through rolling averages and reserve buffers. This system allows individuals to weather periods of low income while participating in the collective wellbeing of the community.</p>
            <p>Beyond financial support, the program fosters connection and accountability. Participants engage in structured monthly conversations with one another, strengthening relational ties and reinforcing trust. These interactions help build a community grounded not just in shared resources, but in mutual care and understanding.</p>
            <p>Legally, the Group Income Program is structured as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit, enabling it to operate as a charitable or research-based organization. Contributions are tax-deductible for U.S. participants, and payouts are structured to comply with tax requirements while maximizing support for recipients. The organization is guided by a board of directors, ensuring fiduciary responsibility and strategic oversight, while day-to-day operations are managed by staff and volunteers.</p>
            <p>The program embodies a vision of a world where economic security is a shared human right, not a privilege. By creating a transparent, accountable, and participatory model of income stabilization, it demonstrates how communities can collectively protect against financial hardship, foster resilience, and empower individuals to live freely beyond the constraints of scarcity.</p>
            <p style="margin-top:18px; color:#6a6a6a;"><strong>Why This Matters:</strong> Economic instability is one of the most pervasive sources of stress, harm, and inequity in society. Traditional safety nets are often insufficient or inaccessible. The Group Income Program offers a community-driven solution that combines financial support with relational engagement, creating both practical and social resilience.</p>

            <h3>Context & Problem</h3>
            <p>Many individuals face economic instability, relational stress, and systemic abuse, limiting freedom, wellbeing, and participation in communities. Existing safety nets are fragmented and often inaccessible.</p>
            <h3>Core Belief / Assumption</h3>
            <p>Economic security is foundational to freedom. Communities thrive when individuals are protected from sudden financial loss and relational exploitation, with tools to flee or shield themselves from abuse.</p>
            <h3>Inputs / Resources</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Financial: participant contributions, grants, donations</li>
                <li>Human: board, staff, volunteers</li>
                <li>Operational: reporting tools, redistribution algorithms, buffer funds</li>
                <li>Community: monthly conversations, affinity groups, safety protocols</li>
                <li>Safety & agency: exit/re-entry mechanisms</li>
                <li>Research & evaluation, PPP frameworks</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Activities</h3>
            <ul>

            <h3>1. Base Contributions</h3>
            <p><strong>Universal Contribution Rate:</strong> 10% of Effective Income (EI) for all participants.</p>
            <p><strong>Effective Income (EI) formula:</strong> EI = actual income + imputed investment income from assets (4% FIRE rule) - eligible debt payments</p>
            <p>Contributions are mandatory for participation, except when EI < 0, in which case contributions = $0. Participants may make additional voluntary contributions to the universal pool or their affinity group pool.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="gi-content-card">
            <h3>2. Affinity Groups</h3>
            <p>Optional, smaller groups within the program for higher internal income sharing.</p>
            <p><strong>Rules:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Base 10% contribution to universal pool remains unchanged.</li>
                <li>Additional contributions within the affinity group are optional and only shared within that group.</li>
                <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> natural test groups to explore different income-sharing models while maintaining the universal baseline.</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="gi-content-card">
            <h3>3. Dynamic Equilibrium & PPP-Adjusted Payouts</h3>
            <p>Annual payout forecasts are announced at the start of each year. Payouts are PPP-adjusted for global participants to ensure equitable real purchasing power. Monthly contributions are reconciled with forecasted payouts. Bonuses may be applied if contributions exceed expectations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="gi-content-card">
            <h3>4. Advance Payouts (Optional Lump Sum)</h3>
            <p>Participants may opt to receive their projected payouts as a <strong>lump sum advance</strong> at any time during the year, rather than receiving monthly payments.</p>
            <p><strong>Eligibility:</strong> Participants must have been a member for at least 12 months before they can access the lump sum advance option.</p>
            <p><strong>How it works:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If a participant's projected monthly payout is $300, they can request an advance of any number of months (up to 12 months) at any point in the year.</li>
                <li>For example, if it's month 6 and they request 6 months, they would receive 6 months × $300 = $1,800. If they request 12 months, they would receive 12 months × $300 = $3,600.</li>
                <li>For the duration of the advance period, they receive <strong>no monthly payouts</strong> (they've already received their projected amount upfront).</li>
                <li><strong>Protection clause (income decreases):</strong> If their actual reported income during any month is <strong>less than projected</strong>, they still receive a prorated monthly payout to ensure they don't fall below the standard baseline.</li>
                <li><strong>Reconciliation clause (income increases):</strong> If their actual reported income during any month is <strong>greater than projected</strong>, they contribute additional funds that month to make up the difference, ensuring the advance remains balanced with their actual financial situation.</li>
                <li>This allows participants to access a larger sum upfront when it's most helpful (e.g., paying off debt, making a major purchase, covering emergency expenses), while maintaining fairness through monthly reconciliation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Research rationale:</strong> Lump sum payments can be more effective than small monthly payments for addressing significant financial needs, reducing stress, and enabling strategic financial decisions.</p>
            <p><strong>Pool considerations:</strong> Advance payouts are funded from the buffer fund and require careful liquidity management to ensure the program can meet all obligations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="gi-content-card">
            <h3>5. Operational Costs & Buffer Fund</h3>
            <p>Fixed operational percentage (e.g., 5%) is allocated from participant contributions to cover program costs. Voluntary donations and affinity group contributions are not subject to operational skim. All operational finances are fully transparent, visible to participants and government regulators.</p>
            <p><strong>Buffer Fund:</strong> Suggested rate of 5% of monthly inflows to absorb short-term fluctuations, support emergency payouts, and stabilize long-term solvency. Fully accounted for in transparency reporting.</p>

            <p>One-time windfalls are treated as wealth, not regular income. Calculated as 10% of imputed annual income if invested using the 4% rule. Contributions from wealth/windfalls are tax-deductible as part of IRS 501(c)(3) contributions.</p>

            <h3>7. Debt Treatment</h3>
            <p>Eligible debt payments reduce Effective Income: mortgage, student loans, medical debt, or other essential debt payments. Participants never receive more than the standard payout, even if EI < 0. This encourages debt payoff while maintaining participant stability. Debt tracking is integrated into participant platform for automated EI calculation.</p>

            <h3>8. Admission, Exit, and Re-entry Policy</h3>
            <p><strong>Admission / Re-admission:</strong> New participants and returning participants go through an application and evaluation process. Criteria include: alignment with program values, financial responsibility, history of exits/contributions, and engagement with community practices. Program may deny re-entry if repeated exits indicate risk to stability.</p>
            <p><strong>Re-entry / Returning Participants:</strong> Entry Count Penalty: each previous exit adds a flat 1% contribution period before ramping via doubling sequence to base rate (10%). No cap on flat period; repeated exits naturally delay full participation. Waitlist: may apply (1–3 months) before rejoining.</p>

            <ul style="margin-top: 15px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Tax advantages for participants:</strong> Contributions are tax-deductible, and payouts are treated as programmatic support rather than taxable income, maximizing the financial benefit to participants.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Research/education alignment:</strong> The program's dual purpose of providing income stability while studying economic cooperation fits perfectly within the 501(c)(3) research/education classification.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Privacy protection:</strong> Participant financial data remains private, while program-level finances are transparent to regulators and participants, balancing individual privacy with organizational accountability.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Credibility and trust:</strong> 501(c)(3) status provides legal recognition, regulatory oversight, and public trust that supports long-term program stability and participant confidence.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>International compliance:</strong> The structure supports international disbursement while maintaining compliance with U.S. tax regulations.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Long-term sustainability:</strong> The nonprofit structure aligns with the program's mission of mutual aid rather than profit, ensuring the organization's purpose remains clear and protected.</li>

            <h3>10. Economic Sustainability & Incentive Alignment</h3>
            <p><strong>Addressing the "Race to Poverty" Concern:</strong> A critical question for any income-sharing system is whether it creates perverse incentives that could lead to a downward spiral where participants reduce income, shrinking the pool, and ultimately making the system unsustainable.</p>
            
            <h4 style="font-size: 20px; color: #2c2c2c; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Built-in Safeguards</h4>
            <ul style="margin-top: 15px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>10% contribution rate preserves strong earning incentives:</strong> Participants keep 90% of their income, meaning the financial benefit of earning more almost always outweighs the benefit of reducing income to get a larger net payout. For example, earning $10,000 more per month increases net income by $9,000, which typically far exceeds any potential increase in program payout.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Imputed investment income (4% rule):</strong> Even if participants stop working, their assets still count toward Effective Income. This means you can't fully escape contributions by reducing earned income—your wealth is still part of the calculation, reducing the incentive to "game" the system through income reduction.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Equal payouts regardless of contribution:</strong> While this might seem like it creates an incentive to reduce income, it actually means that reducing your income doesn't increase your payout—you get the same payout whether you contribute $100 or $1,000. The only way to benefit from reducing income is if the payout is so large relative to your contribution that you'd be better off, which is mathematically unlikely at a 10% contribution rate.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Buffer fund and dynamic equilibrium:</strong> The 5% buffer fund and annual payout forecasting create stability, but more importantly, if the pool shrinks, payouts decrease for everyone. This creates a collective incentive to maintain or grow the pool rather than shrink it.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Community values and engagement:</strong> The program is designed for people who value mutual aid and economic cooperation, not just financial optimization. Monthly conversations, affinity groups, and shared values create social pressure and intrinsic motivation that goes beyond pure economic calculation.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Exit/re-entry penalties:</strong> While participants can leave, re-entry comes with ramped contribution rates that delay full participation. This discourages opportunistic behavior while still allowing genuine exits.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4 style="font-size: 20px; color: #2c2c2c; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Potential Risks & Mitigations</h4>
            <ul style="margin-top: 15px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Risk: High earners exit if they feel they're subsidizing others.</strong> <em>Mitigation:</em> The 10% rate means high earners still keep 90% of their income, and the tax-deductible nature of contributions provides additional benefit. Affinity groups allow high earners to form groups with similar income levels if desired.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Risk: If payouts become very large relative to contributions, incentive to reduce income increases.</strong> <em>Mitigation:</em> This would require the pool to grow significantly, which itself indicates the system is working. The dynamic equilibrium model means payouts adjust based on actual contributions, creating a self-correcting mechanism.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;"><strong>Risk: Coordinated reduction of income by many participants could shrink the pool.</strong> <em>Mitigation:</em> This would require widespread coordination and would harm all participants, including those who reduce income. The collective action problem works both ways—it's hard to coordinate to shrink the pool, just as it's hard to coordinate to grow it.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h4 style="font-size: 20px; color: #2c2c2c; margin-top: 25px; margin-bottom: 15px;">Why This Could Work</h4>
            <p style="margin-top: 15px;">The system is designed as a <strong>research experiment</strong> to test whether income-sharing can work sustainably. Key factors that suggest it could:</p>
            <ul style="margin-top: 15px;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">The 10% contribution rate is low enough that earning incentives remain strong while high enough to create meaningful redistribution.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">The program targets people who already value mutual aid and economic cooperation, not just anyone seeking to maximize personal financial gain.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">The imputed investment income rule prevents gaming through income reduction alone.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Transparency and community engagement create accountability and shared investment in the system's success.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">The buffer fund and dynamic equilibrium provide stability and self-correction mechanisms.</li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 12px;">As a research/education nonprofit, the program can adapt policies based on data and learning, rather than being locked into a rigid structure.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p style="margin-top: 20px; font-style: italic; color: #6a6a6a;">This analysis is part of the ongoing research. The program will track income trends, contribution patterns, and pool health to continuously evaluate and refine the model.</p>

            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p>The Group Income Program is a nonprofit, community-based initiative designed as a research and educational experiment under IRS 501(c)(3) rules. Its primary purpose is to study the effects of shared income, wealth redistribution, and structured financial support on participants' economic stability, wellbeing, and social cohesion. The program combines a baseline income pooling mechanism with optional affinity groups that can share additional income internally, allowing for natural experimental variation.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="gi-content-card">
            <h3>Research Objectives</h3>
            <p>The program seeks to answer key questions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>How does guaranteed group income affect financial security, stress, and perceived freedom among participants?</li>
                <li>How do affinity group structures influence internal cohesion, sharing behavior, and participant satisfaction?</li>
                <li>How do debt, wealth tax, and windfall treatments impact contributions, payouts, and the long-term stability of the system?</li>
                <li>What program design elements maximize equitable outcomes while sustaining the pool for long-term participation and growth?</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Hypotheses:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Participants receiving group income will experience greater economic security and reduced financial stress.</li>
                <li>Affinity groups with higher internal sharing will show stronger intra-group cohesion without reducing fairness across the base pool.</li>
                <li>Transparent, predictable payouts improve trust, engagement, and retention.</li>
                <li>Debt and wealth policies influence participant behavior and pool stability in measurable ways.</li>

            <h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Respect for participant autonomy and voluntary engagement.</li>
                <li>Protection from harm: predictable payouts, minimum contribution floors, and debt adjustments minimize undue financial stress.</li>
                <li>Transparency: all rules, contributions, and aggregate financial data are openly shared.</li>
                <li>Equity: all participants have equal access to base program benefits; affinity groups are voluntary and supplemental.</li>

                <li><strong>Community Engagement:</strong> participation in monthly conversations, affinity group involvement, retention</li>
                <li><strong>Wellbeing Outcomes:</strong> self-reported financial security, stress, and sense of freedom</li>
                <li><strong>Long-Term Growth:</strong> ability to onboard new participants while maintaining equitable distributions and pool stability</li>
