                        <ul>
<li>Core Principles</li>
</ul>
<p>Mutual Respect: Treat all participants with kindness, respect, and empathy. Discrimination, harassment, or abuse is not tolerated.</p>
<p>Transparency: Share information openly about community activities and affinity group decisions where appropriate. Financial transparency at the program level is expected.</p>
<p>Autonomy: Participants have the right to make personal choices, including joining or leaving affinity groups, exiting the program, or adjusting engagement levels.</p>
<p>Equity: Ensure fair treatment and opportunities for all participants, recognizing diverse backgrounds, income levels, and experiences.</p>
<p>Safety & Wellbeing: Prioritize both physical and psychological safety, creating an environment where participants feel protected from harm or abuse.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Communication & Interaction</li>
</ul>
<p>Respectful Dialogue: Engage with others thoughtfully and courteously. Avoid personal attacks, inflammatory language, or public shaming.</p>
<p>Active Listening: Give full attention to others’ perspectives. Strive to understand before responding.</p>
<p>Conflict Resolution: Address conflicts calmly and constructively. Affinity groups may have internal mediation processes, but participants may always leave if unresolved.</p>
<p>Consent Culture: All interactions, including social or collaborative activities, must be consensual.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Participation & Engagement</li>
</ul>
<p>Community Contribution: Engage regularly in program-required activities, such as monthly conversations or group check-ins.</p>
<p>Affinity Groups: Participation is voluntary; members may leave or adjust contribution rules at any time. Decisions should be made collaboratively where possible.</p>
<p>Inclusivity: Encourage diverse perspectives, and avoid creating cliques or exclusionary subgroups outside official affinity groups.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Financial Conduct</li>
</ul>
<p>Honesty in Reporting: Provide accurate information about income, debt, and assets as required for program calculations.</p>
<p>Equitable Sharing: Respect the program’s rules for contributions, payouts, and wealth taxes. Affinity groups may have additional rules, but these must not conflict with the base program.</p>
<p>No Exploitation: Avoid manipulative or abusive behavior to gain advantage from the program or other participants.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Privacy & Confidentiality</li>
</ul>
<p>Individual Financial Data: Personal income, debt, and wealth information is private and protected; do not share another participant’s data without consent.</p>
<p>Program Transparency: Aggregate and program-level financial information is publicly shared for accountability.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Leaving & Re-Entry</li>
</ul>
<p>Autonomy in Exit: Participants may leave the program or any affinity group at any time. They retain previously received funds but forfeit future payouts.</p>
<p>Re-Entry Rules: Contributions start at 1% per program re-entry cycle (per the 1% rule) and increase monthly until base rate is reached.</p>
<p>Community Safety: Participants who repeatedly exit and re-enter or disrupt stability may be subject to review by program administrators for re-entry eligibility.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Affinity Group Guidelines</li>
</ul>
<p>Opt-In / Opt-Out: Members may join multiple affinity groups but cannot exceed 100% of contributions.</p>
<p>Group Management: Affinity groups may be self-managed, but members retain the right to leave individually at any time.</p>
<p>Collective Funds: Groups may manage collective bank accounts for communal projects or nest eggs; rules must be transparent and fair.</p>
<p>Equitable Wealth Growth: Ensure that pooled funds within groups benefit all members, respecting individual contributions and agreed-upon allocations.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Accountability & Reporting</li>
</ul>
<p>Program Oversight: Program administrators and the board ensure rules are followed, and investigate reports of abuse, financial mismanagement, or conflicts.</p>
<p>Participant Responsibility: Members are encouraged to report unsafe or abusive behavior, and participate in feedback processes.</p>
<p>Continuous Improvement: Community guidelines are living documents; updates are made periodically based on participant feedback and research findings.</p>
