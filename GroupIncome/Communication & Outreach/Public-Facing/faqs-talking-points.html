<li>Program Overview</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: What is the Group Income Program?</p>
<p>A: It’s a nonprofit, community-based income sharing system designed to provide a stable, livable baseline income for all participants while fostering mutual support and experimentation in economic stability.</p>
<p>Q: How is this different from traditional welfare or basic income programs?</p>
<p>A: Unlike government programs, this is a community-managed model. Participants contribute a percentage of their income, receive equitable payouts, and can experiment with affinity groups to share resources more collaboratively.</p>
<p>Q: Is this a cooperative?</p>
<p>A: Not exactly. Philosophically, it embraces cooperative principles, but legally it’s structured as a 501(c)(3) nonprofitunder research/education.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Membership & Participation</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: Who can join?</p>
<p>A: Individuals who meet program criteria and agree to participate in the income-sharing system. Membership is reviewed annually, and re-entry is managed carefully to maintain program stability.</p>
<p>Q: Can I leave at any time?</p>
<p>A: Yes. If you leave, you keep funds you’ve already received but forfeit future payouts and no longer contribute.</p>
<p>Q: What are affinity groups?</p>
<p>A: Optional subgroups where participants can share additional income above the base program percentage. Affinity groups may pool funds for collective purposes but members can always leave individually.</p>
<p>Q: Can I be in multiple affinity groups?</p>
<p>A: Yes. Contributions can stack, but total contributions cannot exceed 100% of your income.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Contributions & Payouts</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: How much do I contribute?</p>
<p>A: A base percentage of your income (e.g., 10%) goes into the program pool. Affinity groups may require additional contributions.</p>
<p>Q: How are payouts calculated?</p>
<p>A: Payouts are announced annually based on a conservative estimate of program income. All participants receive the same equitable payout, adjusted for international purchasing power (PPP).</p>
<p>Q: How does debt affect contributions?</p>
<p>A: Effective Income (EI) is reduced by debt payments. High-interest debt is treated the same as other debt for simplicity, so your contributions reflect what you actually have available to support the program.</p>
<p>Q: Are contributions tax-deductible?</p>
<p>A: Yes, as part of the IRS-approved research/education nonprofit framework.</p>
<p>Q: Are payouts considered taxable income?</p>
<p>A: No, payouts are part of the research/education program and are not considered income.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Wealth, Windfalls & Taxes</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: How are windfalls handled?</p>
<p>A: Windfalls are not income-taxed, but a wealth-equivalent tax applies (e.g., based on the 4% FIRE rule) to maintain equity and support the program.</p>
<p>Q: Do I need to report personal financial data to the government?</p>
<p>A: No. Your personal finances are private. The program-level finances are fully transparent.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>International Participants</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: How does the program handle participants in other countries?</p>
<p>A: Payouts are adjusted using the PPP (Purchasing Power Parity) dollar, based on where a participant is living, not citizenship. This ensures equitable access to resources worldwide.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Program Governance</li>
</ul>
<p>Q: Who makes decisions about the program?</p>
<p>A: A Board of Directors oversees compliance, program integrity, and major policy changes. Operational staff handle day-to-day management. Participants have influence through feedback and optional participation in affinity groups.</p>
<p>Q: Can I provide input on rules or payouts?</p>
<p>A: Yes, through surveys, affinity groups, or direct engagement with program staff.</p>
