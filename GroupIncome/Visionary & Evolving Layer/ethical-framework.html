                    <h1 class="sub-title">Ethical Framework</h1>
                    <div class="document-content">
                        <h3>Purpose</h3>
<p>The Ethical Framework establishes the principles by which all decisions, actions, and relationships within the Group Income Program are guided. It ensures that the program operates with integrity, fairness, and accountability, and that all participants and staff act in alignment with the program’s mission, values, and long-term sustainability.</p>
<br>
<h3>Core Ethical Principles</h3>
<ul>
<li>Equity and Fairness</li>
</ul>
<p>All participants are treated equitably regardless of income, background, or circumstance.</p>
<p>Financial contributions, payouts, and program benefits follow transparent formulas that apply consistently to all.</p>
<p>Affinity groups may increase sharing percentages among members, but base contributions and entitlements are equal for everyone.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Autonomy and Respect</li>
</ul>
<p>Every participant has the right to make decisions about their participation, including joining, leaving, or exiting affinity groups, without coercion or penalty.</p>
<p>Respecting autonomy includes ensuring individual financial and social boundaries are honored, and participants can protect themselves from abusive or exploitative situations.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Transparency and Accountability</li>
</ul>
<p>All financial, operational, and governance processes are fully documented and accessible to participants, the Board, and appropriate regulatory bodies.</p>
<p>Decisions affecting payouts, contribution percentages, or program policies are made openly, with conflicts of interest disclosed and recusal enforced where necessary.</p>
<p>The program maintains annual reporting to ensure accountability and ongoing evaluation of program health.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Mutual Care and Solidarity</li>
</ul>
<p>Participants are committed to collective well-being, supporting one another through pooled income and structured community engagement.</p>
<p>The program fosters a culture of care that extends beyond financial support, including mentorship, shared resources, and peer accountability.</p>
<p>Community members are expected to contribute to trust-building and conflict resolution, strengthening social cohesion.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Ethical Stewardship of Resources</li>
</ul>
<p>Financial, social, and informational resources are managed with long-term sustainability in mind, including:</p>
<p>Maintaining a buffer fund for stability.</p>
<p>Applying consistent rules for debt, wealth taxes, and windfalls.</p>
<p>Evaluating potential systemic risks to program solvency.</p>
<p>Participants and Board members are expected to prioritize the health of the collective system over individual gain when making decisions.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Justice and Protection</li>
</ul>
<p>The program actively safeguards participants from economic and social systems of abuse, including discrimination, exploitation, or coercion.</p>
<p>Policies are designed to provide recourse, safe exit options, and transparent dispute resolution for participants in vulnerable positions.</p>
<p>Decisions affecting participants’ eligibility, ramp-up percentages, or contributions are guided by principles of proportionality and fairness.</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Research and Educational Integrity</li>
</ul>
<p>As a 501(c)(3) research/education program, the Group Income Program adheres to rigorous ethical standards in data collection, analysis, and reporting.</p>
<p>Individual financial data is confidential, while aggregated program-level data is shared for research, evaluation, and transparency purposes.</p>
<p>Program experimentation is designed to benefit participants directly and contribute to broader understanding of sustainable income-sharing systems.</p>
<br>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<p>Orientation: All participants and Board members review the Ethical Framework upon joining.</p>
<p>Ongoing Training: Periodic workshops and discussions reinforce ethical decision-making in program governance and participation.</p>
<p>Monitoring: Compliance with ethical principles is monitored via:</p>
<p>Conflict-of-interest disclosures.</p>
<p>Internal audits and participant feedback mechanisms.</p>
<p>Regular evaluation of program outcomes against ethical benchmarks.</p>
<p>Enforcement: Breaches of ethical standards are addressed through transparent, fair, and proportional processes, including mediation, sanctions, or removal from the program or Board where necessary.</p>
<br>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>The Ethical Framework guides the Group Income Program in achieving its mission while protecting participants, promoting fairness, and ensuring the long-term health of the system. It aligns closely with the cultural narrative, operational rules, and research objectives, serving as a moral compass for all program activities.</p>
