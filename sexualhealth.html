</br> Outlined below is my current sexual health to the best of my knowledge. 
</br> Please ask me any questions you might have.

<h3>Status</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Feb 1st, 2022 STI test showed negative results for gonorrhea, chlamydia, HIV, and hep C. Hep B was consistent with vaccine. </li>
  <li>Throat swabs were not available at my testing site.</li>
  <li>I did not do hsv 1/2, although a previous antibody test from many years ago showed positive result for hsv-1 and negative for hsv-2.</li>
  <li>I did go through a scare when I was in high school though which led to the HSV test.  It is abundantly clear to me after talking to several physicians that the likelihood that I had genital HSV is wildly small.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Partners</h3>
My recent-ish sexual partners.
<ul>
  <li>Partner 1: Condoms as protection. Has HSV-1 that expresses around the anus. She is on daily viral suppresants and has not had sores since on the suppressants (December 2020). 
    We use condoms for vaginal penetration and are unprotected for oral sex. We don't do any butt play of any kind. </li>
  <li>Partner 2: has no known STI's. We have not had intercourse since my most recent test, just play with hands. </li>
  <li>Other interactions (e.g. March play party): Making out and play with hands. </li>
</ul>
