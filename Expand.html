        I wake up slowly to a partner stretching me after a restful night&#39s sleep. At first I&#39m not sure what&#39s a dream and what&#39s reality, 
        but just that I&#39m happy, I feel connected, and loved. Soon I&#39m in the full reality of life but I keep my eyes closed as my legs and arms are gently pulled, folded, and contorted. My legs are brought out wide and then folded like a frog&#39s legs.  My knees are pressed down with intent but care.  
        My legs are straightened with traction in line, lengthening my spine. My ankles and each toe is given a little roll, pull, and bend back and forth. 
        I&#39m rolled onto my stomach and one leg is bent again. Her hands massage deeply into the muscles on the cheeks of my butt as she also moves my leg, 
        finding any residual points of tension for release.  After repeating on the other side she moves to sitting on top of me and works my arms up and down. 
        My hands are then given the same attention as my feet were moments ago. Her hands play with my hair and ears before she folds down so her body is pressed 
        up against my back. Bringing her mouth to my ear I hear ever so softly &quot;I love you&quot;. The smile already adorning my face grows even wider.

            What was a moment ago pure relaxation now has flavors of excitement. Her lips now play with my ears.  I&#39m in full joy and excitement which escalates even higher when I feel another pair of hands on my calf.  The touch is playful but intense, even though it&#39s light at first. My mind races not knowing who it is, but just knowing that it&#39s someone I love and trust. Their hand works its way up the inside of my knee, to my inner thigh, grazing my gluteal sulcus, before disappearing from my direct sensory experience. I feel the sharp inhale of my partner lying on top of me and her hips press into me confirming that the touch has now moved to her. A few deep breaths later and she is guided up to a sitting position. I feel the mysterious body&#39s thighs hug mine as I now have two people straddling me. Both hips press forward together and my partner repositions, now sitting on the small of my back with the 3rd person replacing her original spot. My arms reach back and I feel with one hand the leg of my partner and with my other hand the leg of another woman.  Even feeling the shape of her leg, I still don&#39t know for sure who our mysterious companion is.  Both womens hips move back and forth slowly. One of my partner&#39s hands is on my back and I imagine the other is wrapped behind her feeling the head and hair of our companion.  It feels to me as if her neck is being kissed while one hand is on her breast and the other on her inner thigh.  It&#39s not long before I hear them fully kissing. By the way their bodies are moving I can tell that my partner is being pressed firmly against her chest.  Leaving no space between the two of them.  My partner&#39s hand grasps my back and shoulders more firmly as she is held tighter too.  Their rhythm increases to a mini crescendo that is broken by some giggling as things slow down for a second. Multiple hands touch my body and it takes me a second to discern whose is who.

            Our companion moves from her sitting position, and with my partner now more erect on her knees, I&#39m encouraged to roll over. She bends down a little and my hand reaches to her hair and pulls her lips to mine.  We kiss slowly. First with just our lips, but then our tongues, and even some playful nibbles with some smiling faces.  I turn her head and pull her ear to my mouth so I can play with it.  I tell her that I love her.

            My legs are being caressed and a mouth finds its way to my groin crease. She kisses it, with a bit of tongue and my hips writhe as I delight in the almost tickling sensation.

            My legs are being caressed and a mouth finds its way to my groin crease. She kisses it, with a bit of tongue and my hips writhe as I delight in the almost tickling sensation. I&#39m thrilled that she knows I love this without me having to ask.  Her hand presses out my other leg and she repeats on that side.  My partner raises her chest and head from my kiss and I look up. For a moment I take in these two amazing women and am filled with gratitude. I guide her hips forward so that my mouth might play with her lips. As my lips meet hers, my cock feels her tongue, and then her lips too.
